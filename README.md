# Experience
Various Querying, Cleaning and Plotting on the same data.  
  
  This repository is designed to showcase my skills. I do not have any professional experience in the data analyst field. It is my hopes that this will better demonstrate my abilities. In addition, I think it will demonstrate my desire and motivation as well as being self-driven in case I am being considered for a remote (work from home) position. I have taken a csv file with 515,738 rows and 17 columns of hotel reviews. A highly compressed verions of this file is in this repository and named 'Hotel_Reviews.7z'. This file will need to be extracted to run the code on it. If there is a problem with this file, please download the original zip file at https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe. Also, the code for the R report requires a Google API Key to run. This is not provided. If you are going to run the code, you will need to input your key at the appropriate line of code.  
## Tools and methods demonstrated with this data:
  + R, RStudio, Knitter, R Markdown  
    I have included a Word doc demonstrating cleaning and plotting in R that was created using RMD. The original RMD file is included as well. The Word doc is named 'Hotels_with_R.docx' and the RMD file is named 'Hotels with R.Rmd'.
  + Python, Jupyter
    I have included an HTML file demonstrating cleaning and plotting using Python that was created using Jupyter. The HTML file is named 'Jupyter - Python.html' and the original Jupyter script is included and named 'Jupyter - Python.ipynb'. This dataset is one that is the modified one after completing some cleaning with R and is a zip file named 'CleanedHotelReviews.7z'.
   + Tableau
     I have included a pdf document that was created using Tableau named 'Hotel Reviews in Tableau.pdf'. The document illustrates filtering and creating sets along with plotting in Tableau. The original Tableau file is also included and is named 'Hotel Reviews in Tableau.twb'. The compressed data set for this is named 'HotelsForTableau.7z' and is included as well. It was the output file from the Python report.
   + SQL
