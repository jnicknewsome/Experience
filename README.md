# Qualifications
Various Querying, Cleaning and Plotting on the same data.  
This repository is designed to showcase my skills. I do not have any professional experience in the data analyst field. It is my hopes that this will better demonstrate my abilities. In addition, I think it will demonstrate my desire and motivation as well as being self-driven in case I am being considered for a remote (work from homeO position.
I have taken a csv file with 515,738 rows and 17 columns of hotel reviews. It can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe. The file is in this repository and named 'Hotel_Reviews.csv'.
## Tools and methods demonstrated with this data:
  + R, RStudio, Knitter, R Markdown  
    I have included a Word doc demonstrating cleaning and plotting in R that was created using RMD. The original RMD file is included as well. The Word doc is named 'Hotels_with_R.docx' and the RMD file is named 'Hotels with R.Rmd'
